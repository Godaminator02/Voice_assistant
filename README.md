## Overview

This is a voice assistant application built using Flutter for the frontend, Python for backend functionality, and Firebase for authentication and data storage. The app allows users to interact with a voice-based assistant that can perform various tasks and respond to voice commands.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition:** The app utilizes speech-to-text functionality to recognize voice commands.
- **Assistant Interaction:** Users can interact with the voice assistant to perform tasks or get information.
- **Firebase Integration:** Firebase is used for authentication and data storage, providing a secure and scalable backend.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter:** Flutter is a UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Python:** Python is used for backend logic and handling voice commands.
- **Firebase:** Firebase provides authentication services and data storage for user information.
